# Tree Data Structure in C++

This project implements a Tree data structure in C++.

## Features

- Implementation of a binary tree
- Insertion of nodes to the left and right
- Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversal
- Searching for nodes

## Concepts Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- C++ programming

## Usage

To run the program, compile and execute the `tree.cpp` file. The main function demonstrates the creation of a tree and various operations on it.

```sh
g++ tree.cpp -o tree
./tree
